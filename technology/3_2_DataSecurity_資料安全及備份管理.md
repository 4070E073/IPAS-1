https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/what-is/data-security

[Data Masking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13602/data-masking)
Data masking refers to the process of changing certain data elements within a data store so that the structure remains similar 
while the information itself is changed to protect sensitive information. 
Data masking ensures that sensitive customer information is unavailable beyond the permitted production environment. 
This is especially common when it comes to situations like user training and software testing.
